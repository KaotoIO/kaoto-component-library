# Kaoto Component Library
## **THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

This repo provides a wrapper around [Kaoto UI](https://www.github.com/KaotoIO/kaoto-ui) that exposes it for consumption as a component library.

The code within this package is for a Kaoto editor.

It is considered a prototype.

Code herein is subject to change without notice.

Nothing should be considered concrete at this point.

In order to run the development webapp:

`pnpm start`
